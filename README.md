# instagramphotofeed
This is an excercise to show an instagram photo feed

Please copy the code from the index_html file into GitPod. Extension must be .html
Then, copy the code from the styles_css file into GitPod. Extension must be .css. Please name it styles.css in order to match the reference from the HTML file.
Then, open the browser preview to see the website that I created.
